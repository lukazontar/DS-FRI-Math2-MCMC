# Mathematics 2: MCMC Homework repository (DS@FRI UNI-LJ)
This is a repository for Mathematics 2 MCMC course at DataScience@FRI at University of Ljubljana.

## Repository structure
- `HW Part 3.Rmd` - R Markdown file that includes the main functionality and can be used to reproduce the results.
- `results/` - Folder that includes the log files of results and plots.
- `library/hamiltonian_monte_carlo.R` - R script that includes functions where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is implemented.
- `library/metropolis_hastings.R` - R script that includes functions where Metropolis Hastings sampling algorithm is implemented.
- `library/rejection_sampling.R` - R script that includes functions where Rejection sampling algorithm is implemented.
- `library/diagnostics.R` - R script that includes helper functions to generate results for different scenarios, i.e. samples, and transform them to more understandable metrics and visualizations to easily evaluate results.
- `Report.pdf` - Homework report generated in Latex.
